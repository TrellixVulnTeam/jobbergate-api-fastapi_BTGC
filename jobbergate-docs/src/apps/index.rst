 Jobbergate Apps
=================

Jobbergate is comprised of 3 separate python applications that work in concert. These
applications allow Job Scripts to be created and submitted to a `Slurm`_ cluster without
the Jobbergate user having to inteact directly with Slurm or remotely access the cluster
by command line at all.

An overview for each and a usage document are included in the pages listed below.
